    //NOTE - Delete the class after finishing up the project (no zombie code)
    //TO DO LIST - STUFF CAN BE ADDED EVERYDAY
    //right display size 
    //Welcome UI screen with a play btn instructions and exit and credits title with the 2names and i wanna be mercy - done
    //recursion? maybe in the customer spawn method kinda tricky gotta tackle that at one point for the whole game to work (core)
    //music - nick
    //graphics - in progress
    //Figure out pic (only works in debug mode)
    //OBJECTIVE:
    //ai will create linked list of ingridients from the classes called order there is going to be 2 types
    //normalOrder and vipOrder - noice
     //player will need to complete them by using buttons in a select time
     //liked list will only check for the size and if the items are all thre in no particular order
     //if all the items are there the player will be rewared mney which will be displayed
     //At the start of the game player could choose his name that will also be displayed
     //game ends when a) player fails to complete an order or b)(prefered) timer runs out
     // OPTIONAL player has 3 hearts if player fails an order one heart goes down until game ends
     // stuff that could sneak in: A recursion method, and maybe some abstract class and methods should be good
     //than user will build its own linked lsit uding the buttons and the 2 lsit will be checked for the same contens insdie them
     //than user linked list will be cleared rinse repeat while a new customerr will spawn with a recursion method or something
     //and classes would be used to like connect bettwen the stuff
